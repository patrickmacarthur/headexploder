HeadExploder
============

A tool to "explode" a C++ header file containing one or more classes into a C++
source file.

Please note that this tool was made for my own use and makes many terrible
assumptions about the formatting of your source file.  For one, it requires
that comments for methods are below the declarations of the methods:

   int method( int a ) const;
     // my comment

This is because this is the way my CS professor formats his header files, and I
have only used this tool on header files in this format.

Usage:
  $ headexploder <header file> <file to create>

Example:
  $ headexploder MyClass.h MyClass.cc
